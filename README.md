#**sirAccordion** for AngularJS

**VERSION 1 RELEASED!**

Awesome dynamic, recursive, customizable and multilevel **Accordion Menu** for **AngurlarJS**, that builds up from a **JSON object** and an optional configuration object.
**You can download the project for a live demo in the example folder (don't forget to bower install dependencies) and for better understanding.**

##[sir Accordion Online Demo](http://sirideas.github.io/sirAccordion/)

        bower install sir-accordion

##**Features**

*   **Dynamic content:** if the scope that contains the JSON object is update the accordion updates too.
*   **Responsive:** The item height adjust to the content and is responsive; the width of the accodion adjusts to 100% of the wrapper tag.
*   **Easy use AngularJS Directive:** you just need to add the js and css files, add the *'sir-accordion'* module to the AngularJS app and call the directive like this:

        //Code for the html directive
        <div sir-accordion collection="collection" config="accordionConfig"></div>

        //Code for the Angular module
        .module('mainModule', ['sir-accordion'])
* **JSON object**: the content of the accordion will be set by a JSON following the next structure where `subCollection` is an object of the same structure that will have more items to expand/collapse inside, `topContent` will be the content on top of that subCollection and `botomContent` will be after the subCollection items.

        //JSON object model
        $scope.collection = 
        [{"title":"Level 1 header","topContent":"","bottomContent":"","subCollection":[]}]; 
*   **Customizable:** you can customize by a config `$scope` like this:

        $scope.accordionConfig = {
            debug: false, //For developing
            animDur: 300, //Animations duration minvalue is 0
            expandFirst: false, //Auto expand first item
            autoCollapse: true, //Auto collapse item flag
            watchInternalChanges: false, //watch internal attrs of the collection (false if not needed)
            headerClass: '', //Adding extra class for the headers
            beforeHeader: '', //Adding code or text before all the headers inner content
            afterHeader: '', //Adding code or text after all the headers inner content
            topContentClass: '', //Adding extra class for topContent
            beforeTopContent: '', //Adding code or text before all the topContent if present on item
            afterTopContent: '', //Adding code or text after all the topContent if present on item
            bottomContentClass: '', //Adding extra class for topContent
            beforeBottomContent: '', //Adding code or text before all the topContent if present on item
            afterBottomContent: '' //Adding code or text before all the topContent if present on item
        };
*   **Isolated Scope:** The directive has an isolated scope but you can pass any scope you'll need to handle inside the accordion   with the 'data' attr. 
*   **MultiLevel:** the recursive algoritm allows to add as many levels to the accordion as you would like to.
*   **VelocityJS:** sirAccordion uses [VelocityJS](https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity) for the slide up and down animations.
*   **ie8 Compatible:** please kill ie8.
*   **No jQuery** dependency.
*   **Bower installable package**. To install from bower use `bower install sir-accordion`.
*   **Events**.
    *   When the accordion is donde loading you can catch the event like this `$scope.$on('sacDoneLoading', function ($event) {})`.
    *   When an element is expanded `sacExpandStart` and `sacExpandEnd` are emitted with the coordinates of the element.
    *   When an element is collapsed `sacCollapseStart` and `sacCollapseEnd` are emitted with the coordinates of the element.
    *   For expanding any content from your AngularJs App `$scope.$broadcast('sacExpandContentById','1-1-3')` where the second parameter is the content coordinates.
    *   For collapsing any content from your AngularJs App `$scope.$broadcast('sacCollapseContentById','1-1-3')` where the second parameter is the content coordinates.
    *   For collapsing all contents `$scope.$broadcast('sacCollapseAll');`
    *   When autoCollapse is `false` you can trigger this event too `$scope.$broadcast('sacExpandAll');`.
